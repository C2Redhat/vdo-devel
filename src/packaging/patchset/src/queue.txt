Add specialized request queueing functionality.

This change adds funnel queue, a mostly lock-free multi-producer,
single-consumer queue.  It also adds a request queue based on the funnel
queue. This will be used by the dm-vdo deduplication index for maximum
throughput, which is absolutely critical to inline deduplication.
