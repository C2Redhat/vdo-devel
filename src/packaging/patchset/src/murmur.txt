Add the MurmurHash3 fast hashing algorithm.

MurmurHash3 is a fast non-cryptographic hash. It was originally
written by Austin Appleby and placed in the public domain. This
version has been modified to produce the same result on both big
endian and little endian processors, making it suitable for use in
portable persisted data.
